## Overview

I want to become a great and even better front end engineer so I'm going to keep building. Inspired by a really nice dev I met. 

Time to create: 4 hours and 36 mins.

In the video, I go from a single screenshot and create-react-app (read: from nothing!) to an initial component-based implementation in React.

	* Categories Row
	* Available Food
  	* Explore Navigation Section  / Shopping Cart

Tech Used
* React Native
* Expo 
* Linear Gradient
* React Navigation
* Styled Components (Attempted)

Learnings / Challenges
* Need to figure out a better Styling system in React native. Not as smooth as React with StyledComponents
* A lot of switching back and forth context mindset is necessary to adapt when switching between technologies
* Exporting of some components sucked

Improvements
* Not copy paste
* Modular components / breaking out
